# LaTeX-templates

A collection of private LaTeX and KOMA-script templates.

## Usage

To prevent storing sensitive information in the public repository and to improve the ease of 
usage the provided templates here you can refer to the `config_example.tex` files.

Those files can be renamed to `config.tex` files and then can be used to provide your custom data.

The same procedure can be applied for logos or any other images.

The `config.tex` file is also declared in the `.gitignore` file.

## Paradigma

Templates itself are stored under `src` folders.
Logos and images (and any other assets) are stored under `assets` folders.
In some cases options or even the pre-amble is outsourced. Those files are stored under the `opts` folder.

## Samples

Samples, mainly generated PDF files are stored in the `samples/` folder.
This is just to give a quick overview of the generated file types.
